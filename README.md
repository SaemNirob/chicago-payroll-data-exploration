# City of Chicago Payroll Data Exploration

This project focuses on exploring the **City of Chicago Payroll Data** using **Python** and **Pandas**. The goal was to perform basic data exploration and understand the dataset’s structure and key features.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the payroll dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Initial Exploration**: Displayed the first few rows and checked the general structure of the data.
3. **Data Information**: Obtained summary statistics and general information about the dataset using `.info()` and `.head()`.
4. **Missing Values**: Checked for any missing data using `.isnull().sum()` to identify areas for data cleaning.

## Tools & Libraries:
- **Python** (for data analysis)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

## Future Work:
This is just the beginning! In future updates, I plan to:
- Perform more advanced data cleaning techniques
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implement data visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Explore advanced statistical methods
